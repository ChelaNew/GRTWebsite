              <p>The game for the 2005 season is played on a 27' wide by 52' long playing field with the 9 goals configured in 3 x 3 matrix, similar to tic-tac-toe. The robots will attempt to place the red and blue game tetras in or on one or more of the nine goals to score points and "claim ownership" of the goals. Two alliances – one "red" and one "blue" – composed of three teams each compete in each match. The object of the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent alliance by placing tetras on or into goals, getting three goals in a row capped with tetras, and/or having all three robots on an alliance in their end zone at the end of the match.</p>
