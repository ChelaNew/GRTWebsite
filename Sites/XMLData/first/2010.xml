              <p>BREAKAWAYâ„¢, the 2010 game, is very close to soccer. There are four goals, one in each corner of the field. Soccer balls are strewn about the field and could be used by either team. In addition two large speed bumps that spanned the width of the field and divided it into 3 zones limited travel from one set of goals to another. There are tunnels located through the center of the bumps, and platforms on top of the tunnels. Points could be scored in two ways: by scoring soccer balls into one's goal or by elevating onto the platform during the Finale period. Bonus points were additionally rewarded for climbing onto another robot that is elevated.</p>
