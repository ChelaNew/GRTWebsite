            <p>The Gunn Robotics Team (GRT) was founded in 1996 by Bill Dunbar, a mechanical engineer and physics teacher at Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto, CA. At the time, the Engineering Technology program was diminishing with an all-male class consisting of only 8 students. However, Bill revived the class by in no small part involved several at risk students, and introducing them to engineering.</p>

            <p>The newly formed team took over the abandoned wood and metal shop that was about to be closed on Gunn's campus.  After fighting with the school district for funding, they finally set up the school's first robotics team and entered the FIRST Robotics Competition in 1997.  That summer, they traveled directly to the National Championships in Orlando, Florida.</p>

            <p>The team has evolved greatly over its nineteen years of existence. Today, GRT is one of the school district's most prized programs. From those first 8 students, we have grown to our regular enrollment of 54 members, who work in a variety of different subgroups ranging from welding to the drivetrain.  Our growth as a team has received a lot of positive feedback from our community as well.  In the offseason, we build projects for local schools and communities. We have been fortunate to work with generous sponsors, who assist us with resources and training.</p>

            <p>A major part of our team identity is our student involvement. Every aspect of the team that could be operated by a student is: design prototyping, computer modeling of design, and operation of tools, from manual mills and lathes, to a CNC mill and welding. Our students do it all. We write our own software and wire our own robots. Students also run our business team, and manage our sponsorships and outreach events. Being on the Gunn Robotics Team gives every student the opportunity to experience leadership, and produce something amazing in the process.</p>
