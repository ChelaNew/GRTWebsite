              <p>Aerial Assist is played by two competing Alliances of three robots each on a flat 25' x 54' foot field, straddled by a truss suspended just over five feet above the floor. The objective is to score as many balls in goals as possible during a two-minute and thirty-second match. The more Alliances score their balls in their goals, and the more they work together to do it, the more points their Alliance receives.</p>
