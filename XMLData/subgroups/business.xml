                <p><span class="title bold">About</span>The Business group of the Gunn Robotics Team is primarily responsible for funding and outreach. We represent GRT when applying for grants, sponsorships, and competing for awards. We write all of the essays that are needed for awards and manage our interactions with other entities, such as corporations and community members. A second goal is to reach out to the community to help spread knowledge about robotics and engineering. Every year, our team hosts an FLL qualifying tournament and a robotics-focused summer camp to give younger students hands-on opportunities with engineering. We also participate in additional events such as the Palo Alto May Fete Parade, Apricot STEM Fair, and the Nixon Elementary School Science Night to showcase our robot.

                <p><span class="title bold">Update</span>In 2020-2021, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, the business group continued with their usual duties, writing essays and applications week by week and preparing the new generation of team to carry the torch forward. The team has completed applications for the Gene Haas grant, essays and presentation scripts for the Chairmanâ€™s Award, and Business Models and Pitches for the FIRST Innovation Challenge.
