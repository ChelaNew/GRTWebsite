                <p><span class="title bold">Purpose</span>The Animation Team is a subgroup that produces 3D animations to compete for the annual Safety Animation Award and Digital Animation Award. The subgroup works with software such as Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere to create original and expressive animations while highlighting some of the mediums most exciting possibilities. Members of the Animation Team work together to write stories, model objects, animate characters, and render scenes.</p>

                <p><span class="title bold">What We Do</span>When the Animation Team is not hard at work on a full-length animation, its members work on personal projects and website content to improve their animating skills. Personal modeling projects range from cream-filled cookies to old wooden buckets and anything in between. The extra time spent experimenting in Maya helps teach new team members faster and more effective techniques.</p>
