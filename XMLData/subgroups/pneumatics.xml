              <p><span class="title bold">Training</span>
              To start pneumatics training we learn all of the components (e.g. tubing, actuators, solenoids, tanks, 
            and safety equipment) so everyone understands the basic concepts behind each piece of equipment.
            Practice exercises are assigned, such as turning two single acting solenoids into one double
            acting solenoid. Planning, assembling and troubleshooting all of the pneumatics components required 
            for the “haunted house” project is the main training activity before build season.
