            <p><span class="title bold">About</span>
            Pneumatics is the branch of engineering that involves the transmission of power using pressurized air (instead of, for instance, electricity). Typically, pressurized air (<100 pise) is stored in a tank using a compressor, and then it's released from the tank using pressure regulators, valves, and tubing. GRT's robots often have pneumatic systems powering mechanical parts, especially mechanisms that require motion.

            <p><span class="title bold">Updates</span>
            Due to the COVID-19 spread and our decisions to keep our team healthy, the GRT shop has been closed since March of 2020. As a result, the GRT pneumatics subgroup has not been involved in any design projects this year.

              <p><span class="title bold">Training</span>
              To start pneumatics training we learn how to be safe using compressed air, and then go on to pneumatic components (e.g. tubing, actuators, solenoids, tanks, and safety equipment) so everyone understands the basic concepts behind each piece of equipment. Practice exercises are assigned, such as turning two single acting solenoids into one double acting solenoid. Planning, assembling, and troubleshooting all of the pneumatics components required for the "haunted house" project is the main training activity before build season.
