                Pneumatics is the branch of engineering htat involves the tarnsmission of power using pressurized air (instead of, for instance, electricity). Typically, pressurized air (<100 psi) is stored in a tank using a compressor, and then its release from the tank is controlled using pressure regulators, valves, and tubing. GRT's robots often have pneumatic systems powering mechanical parts, especially mechanisms that require linear motion.

                Every year the pneumatics group plans the use and placement of pneumatic system components for both a fall "haunted house" project for a local elementary school, and for the FIRST competition robot.
