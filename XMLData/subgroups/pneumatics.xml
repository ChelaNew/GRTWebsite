                Pneumatics is the branch of engineering htat involves the tarnsmission of power using pressurized air (instead of, for instance, electricity). Typically, pressurized air (<100 psi) is stored in a tank using a compressor, and then its release from the tank is controlled using pressure regulators, valves, and tubing. GRT's robots often have pneumatic systems powering mechanical parts, especially mechanisms that require linear motion.
