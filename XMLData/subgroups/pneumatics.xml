            <p><span class="title bold">About</span>
            Pneumatics is the branch of engineering that involves the transmission of power using pressurized air (instead of, for instance, electricity). Typically, pressurized air (<100 pise) is stored in a tank using a compressor, and then it's released from the tank using pressure regulators, valves, and tubing. GRT's robots often have pneumatic systems powering mechanical parts, especially mechanisms that require motion.

            <p><span class="title bold">Projects</span>
            Every year, the pneumatics group plans the use and placement of pneumatic system components for both the fall "haunted house" project for a local elementary school, and for the FIRST competition robot.

              <p><span class="title bold">Training</span>
              To start pneumatics training we learn  how to be safe since compressed air is incredibly dangerous, and then go on to components (e.g. tubing, actuators, solenoids, tanks,
              and safety equipment) so everyone understands the basic concepts behind each piece of equipment. Practice exercises are assigned, such as turning two single acting solenoids into one double acting solenoid. Planning, assembling, and troubleshooting all of the pneumatics components required for the "haunted house" project is the main training activity before build season.
