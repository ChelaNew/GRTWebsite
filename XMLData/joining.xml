            <p><span class="bold">Requirements for joining:</span> The Gunn Robotics Team is open to all sophomores, juniors and seniors at Gunn High School. No prior knowledge or classes are required for acceptance, although engineering classes such as Introduction to Engineering Design or Principles of Engineering offered at Gunn would teach skills incredibly beneficial to success on the team.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Applying for the team:</span> Applications to join the team are available in the guidance offices while course selection is open. It is recommended to pick up the forms as early as they are available, to allow adequate time to thoughtfully complete the responses. Further details of this process are listed on the form and questions may be directed appropriately from our contact page.</p>
