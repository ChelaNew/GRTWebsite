            <p>The Gunn Robotics Team (GRT) is a student-managed team that designs, builds and enters a robot in several FIRST Robotics competitions each year.  A major part of our team identity is our student ownership.  Every aspect of the team that can be executed or managed by a student, is:  leadership, organization and planning, gearbox and mechanism design; prototyping and computer simulations; fabrication using milling machines, lathes, CNC, welding and more; coding and animation; fund-raising; outreach.  Our students do it all.  We CAD our own designs, write our own software, and wire our own robots; we manage our sponsorships, organize and staff outreach events.  Being on the Gunn Robotics Team gives every student the opportunity to make real decisions, learn from the results, and produce something amazing in the process.</p>

            <p>GRT was founded in 1996 by Bill Dunbar, a mechanical engineer turned physics teacher at Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto, CA. At the time, the schools Engineering Technology program was diminishing, with only one class of eight (all male) students. </p>
