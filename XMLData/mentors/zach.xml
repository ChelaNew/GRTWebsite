            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I am a mechanical engineer (because software and electrical are made up) with knowledge focused on complex component and mechanism design based in CAD and real world testing.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I graduated from THE Ohio State University and initially worked on steering systems in the Honda world.  I am now constantly learning and developing from leading the steering, suspension and brakes design at Lucid Motors.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I began mentoring GRT in the fall of 2020. I was extremely blessed to have &quot;grown up&quot; volunteers spend time teaching me in my extra-curricular activities in high school and believe I am supposed to give that back.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>Honestly, I love it every time a design fails and the students have to ask themselves what the heck just happened. It is such an amazing way to really understand the physics of our world.</p>
