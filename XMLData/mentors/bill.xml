            <p>Bill founded GRT in 1996 and led GRT from from 1996 to 2012</p>
            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I am a mechanical engineer and a teacher, when I started GRT I wanted to make a place where students could do projects, for me thats super important.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I have Stanford Engineering degrees and I worked at Lockheed Martin and Intel before I came into teaching.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I have not been very central to GRT for several years, but the thing that I most wanted to achieve with the robotics team was to give a place for students to call home on campus. A place where people could follow through with projects and feel as if they were a part of a group on campus.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>I secretly love the night before we ship the robot. Every year its different. Some years its a complete disaster, and some years it seems like everything goes well. But that last night is magical because thats when we really come together as a team.</p>
