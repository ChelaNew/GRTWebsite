            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I have experience teaching and using CAD and other engineering skills, in product development and hardware/software troubleshooting, and in project team development and management. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>My BA chemistry degree is from Cornell University.  I spent a few decades developing laboratory instrumentation at HP/Agilent and a handful of start-ups, starting as a chemist and then segueing into software engineer, product manager and project manager.  I took up my second career as a STEM teacher in 2010. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>Teaching the class required of all GRT members (Engineering Technology) is what brought me to Gunn HS in 2012.  My decision to apply for the position was set by an invitation to a summer shop training session, where I was really impressed with GRT's shop equipment, the excellent mentors, and the enthusiasm and skill of the students.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>Teaching the GRT classes and living with the team during build and competition season each year allows me to really get to know the students.  That, plus watching students grow from year to year, provides a much deeper teacher-student relationship than the typical classroom experience.</p>

            Interview With Charlie Mayman

            <![CDATA[
            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>In addition to knowing several programming languages, I am fluent in the software development process in its many forms--especially the form it takes when software and hardware are co-developed, as they are at GRT. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I earned my EE degree at Stanford University.  Since then I have spent 35 years writing software in Silicon Valley for start-ups, small established companies, and large corporations, working primarily on real-time embedded systems. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I started mentoring GRT students in 2009-2010 when my son was a team member (welder); I have stayed to help every year since (except for two seasons when I was trapped by the sirens call of the start-up). Having always struggled professionally to hire engineers with real-time experience, I see FIRST Robotics as a starting point for coders who can eventually fill this need.  My goal is to show students that embedded software engineers make the coolest things.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>I recall a conversation with a student who had a brilliant algorithm that was too complex to implement. Through questioning I tried to suggest possible simplifications (engineering "approximations"). The algorithm was eventually abandoned, but was the start of turning a theoretician into an engineer.</p>

            Interview With Karl Van Dyk
        </SSTitle>
        <SSBody>
            <![CDATA[
            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I have decades of experience with most things mechanical, such as:  how to hold parts while machining them, short cuts for operations and novel ideas for mechanisms. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I got my electronics training from the US Air Force, and machining and design experience from half a century of working in the industry at a myriad of machine shops and engineering companies.  I started working in my father's shop machining magnesium housings for Hughes Aircraft at age 12, and continued working there for 15 years.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I read a notice in the SRI company newsletter asking if anyone wanted to volunteer at Gunn HS for the robotics team (then taught by Bill Dunbar). That was in 2006, and I've been mentoring GRT ever since.  I also mentor a team in Placerville, CA on the weekends.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>My favorite experience in GRT is giving a suggestion on how to do a machining operation or how to hold a part that is tricky. That requires some thinking outside the box. Also watching how the concept comes to light for the students.  Passing on knowledge to someone so it doesn't get lost -- that is gratifying for me.</p>

            Interview With Phil Roan

        <SSBody>
            <![CDATA[
            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I am a robotics engineer with a focus on hardware for robots and robotic systems.  I bring a wide variety of engineering and management experience to share with GRT -- in particular, topics of system understanding, system integrations, electrical and mechanical design, software design and development best practices, user experience and user interfaces, project management, and occasional homework help.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I began my robotics training by building things with Legos.  My BS degrees in EE/CS and Mechanical Engineering are from UC Berkeley, and my Ph.D. in EE, with a focus on surgical robotics, is from University of Washington.  I have worked as a robotics and research engineer with Bosch since 2010. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I have enjoyed working with high school students since college summers as a camp counselor, so it was just a matter of finding the time to join GRT once I started working next door with Bosch. I have been a GRT mentor since 2013. </p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>I really like being greeted by name when I walk in the door -- who doesn't want to feel like a rockstar?  Working with high school students is enjoyable because they are very eager to learn and become independent thinkers and yet are responsive to reasoned guidance. GRT students keep me on my toes and inspire me to learn new things.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I have a lot of experience with practical mechanism design, fabrication and test, having spent years getting things to work in real life.  I bring my experience in mechanical and pneumatic systems, project management, leadership, general hardware repair, shop safety and playing well with others, and enjoy winding down from my workday by mentoring GRT students 10-20 hours a week all year long.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I completed general engineering and paramedic coursework at college and in the army.  I managed the MidTown bicycle shop for many years, and spent the last 25+ years as a lead mechanic at the Valley Transit Authority, redressing design problems in VTA buses and teaching other mechanics.  I was a boy scout leader for 15 years, including work with disabled scouts.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I started mentoring GRT in 2002-2003 when my son was a team member, and have stayed to help ever since.  I enjoy working with the team during both the fall (shop training and small projects) and FIRST build season.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>I love to watch the students work through their ideas to reach a solution, when the lightbulb goes off.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <b2><span class="bold">What area of expertise do you bring to GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I am a mechanical engineer and a teacher, when I started GRT I wanted to make a place where students could do projects, for me thats super important.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">Where did you get your training/education?</span></b2>
            <p>I have Stanford Engineering degrees and I worked at Lockheed Martin and Intel before I came into teaching.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What lead you to mentoring GRT & how long have you mentored GRT?</span></b2>
            <p>I have not been very central to GRT for several years, but the thing that I most wanted to achieve with the robotics team was to give a place for students to call home on campus. A place where people could follow through with projects and feel as if they were a part of a group on campus.</p>

            <b2><span class="bold">What is your favorite GRT experience?</span></b2>
            <p>I secretly love the night before we ship the robot. Every year its different. Some years its a complete disaster, and some years it seems like everything goes well. But that last night is magical because thats when we really come together as a team.</p>
