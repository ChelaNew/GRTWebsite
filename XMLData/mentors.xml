            <p> &emsp;At GRT, we pride ourselves on being primarily student-led, but we could not achieve any of our successes without the incredible guidance of our mentors. Our mentors come from a wide range of engineering backgrounds, which means they all have something unique and valuable to teach us. There is a saying, &quot;give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.&quot; Our mentors are extremely adept at giving us the tools we need to find answers and innovate, they &quot;teach us to fish.&quot; </p>
