           <p><span class="title bold">About</span>The controls group is responsible for two main tasks: electrical design and wiring, and software coding. Electrical design involves working with mechanism and drive train teams to incorporate sensors that will collect information necessary to run the robot, and uses technical skills such as crimping, soldering and troubleshooting to complete the wiring on the robot. Software coding involves designing and writing the code that makes all the mechanisms move while collecting data from on-board sensors, allowing the robot to operate in both autonomous mode and from the driver station in tele-operation mode. Our code is written in Python, which not only allows for fast coding during build and competition but is also easy to teach to inexperienced coders. Our code repositories are available at:      <a href = "https://github.com/grt192" target="_blank"> https://github.com/grt192</a>.
